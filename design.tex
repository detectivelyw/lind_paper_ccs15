\section{A New Design for Building Secure Systems}
\label{sec.design}

\cappos{My thought: Section 2 argued we need to execute kernel code, including 
some `risky' functionality to make programs work.  Section 3 argued that `risky'
functionality is where vulnerabilities are likely to be.  Here we show how
to have a design that allows `risky' functionality to execute without 
causing a security problem.  Key idea: build a sandbox from safe functionality
and reimplement risky functionality inside of it.  We say all of this, but
some of it requires a careful read.}

\cappos{It is good to make the threat model explicit, but I'm not sure here
is the place to do it.  We've already been talking about zero-day kernel
vulnerabilities.  It may make sense to locate the threat model earlier on.
(Perhaps around section 2.)}

Our goal is to build secure systems that can mitigate the problem of kernel exploitation effectively. 
As we have discussed in the motivation section \S{2} before, one key reason that many previous work 
failed to prevent kernel exploitation effectively is that there was not enough knowledge about 
which portions of the kernel can be safely exposed to the user applications. 
And there was no standard method to acquire this knowledge. 
The metric we introduced in \S{3} is devised to serve the purpose of having a standard method to 
obtain better understanding of the kernel, and to know which portions of the kernel can be safely exposed. 
As we discussed in \S{3}, our findings suggest that commonly used kernel paths contain few bugs.
We shall then use this important result to create a new design for building secure systems. 

\subsection{Threat Model}
In our threat model, threats refer to any behavior, either intentional or accidental, that may cause potential harm 
to the system. Threats may be triggered by malicious code or bugs in non-malicious programs.

In order to fully execute their functions, applications need to have access to a set of privileges provided by 
the operating system, usually exposed as system calls. The primary security goal of a secure system is to 
restrict a program to some subset of privileges, usually by exposing a set of functions that mediate 
access to the underlying operating system privileges. Threats occur when applications obtain access to 
privileges that were not intentionally exposed by the system, thus escaping the protection 
intended by the secure system \cite{Repy:10}.

To pose threats to a secure system, we assume that applications may use multiple threads to modify visible 
state or issue concurrent requests which may trigger a race condition. Our goal is to prevent bugs in 
the code from allowing an user program to escape the secure system to access the kernel code, and 
possibly trigger kernel bugs.

\subsection{Design of Architecture}
To build secure systems, our design needs to effectively construct a safe environment in which user programs 
can run without worrying about triggering kernel bugs and break the whole system. To achieve this security goal, 
our secure system should be placed in the user space, and exist as a key layer between the user applications 
and the underlying Operating System kernel. To complete the architecture of the system, there are three critical 
questions that need to be answered. First of all, how should our system access the kernel? Secondly, what interface 
should our system provide to the user programs? Finally, how to implement the inside of our system to make it work?

To begin with, the key question related with security is how should our system access the kernel. Since now we know 
that commonly used kernel paths contain few bugs, it would be desirable to design a system that only access the 
commonly used kernel paths. Through our findings in \S{3}, we can see that commonly used kernel paths have relatively 
small size. This is positive for our design, because it shows that it is possible to design a system with a very small 
trusted computing base. Thus, our design should only access fundamental system calls within commonly used kernel paths. 
This gives our design a very small trusted computing base that places only very limited trust in the kernel code. Therefore, 
our design barely has the chance to trigger kernel bugs and cause serious security problems. 

Next, what interface should our system provide to the user programs? Essentially, this represents the tradeoff between 
security and functionality. Our goal is to provide strong protection to our system, therefore, security is prioritized. We are willing 
to sacrifice certain functionality if better security can be achieved. Thus, our design provides a POSIX API to user programs with 
support of fundamental functions. In fact, a restricted POSIX API is good enough to support many popular applications, 
and even some very complex legacy applications. 

Finally, how to implement the inside of our systems? 
To provide a rich POSIX API to user programs, while accessing the kernel only in commonly used path requires our system to 
reconstruct and reimplement many functions inside our system. Since the reimplementation itself is hard and may contain bugs 
and raise security concerns, in our design, we require the reimplementation to be done inside a sandbox. Within a contained 
environment, the reimplementation can construct the POSIX API effectively, without worrying about break other parts of the system.  

\subsection{Conclusion}
We have shown that using our finding that commonly used kernel paths contain few bugs as a key principle, a new design was created 
for building secure systems. Our design accesses only commonly used kernel paths, placing very limited trust within the kernel code. 
To provide sufficient functionality to user programs, our design safely reimplement fundamental functions inside a sandbox. Thus, many 
popular user applications and legacy programs can be supported by the POSIX API our system provides, while security will not be violated 
with the isolation provided by the sandbox. 

The design we described here doesn't rely on any specific technique or tool. To implement our design, it is possible to choose different techniques 
that suit well with specific needs or requirements. In the next section (\S{5}), we describe one implementation we did using our design.
