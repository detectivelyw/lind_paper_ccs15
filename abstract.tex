Securing the Operating System (OS) kernel (or hypervisor) is essential for
building secure systems.  Yet despite substantial effort, kernels still 
contain bugs and are exploitable.  In this paper, we explain why existing 
techniques fail to protect the kernel effectively.  Moreover, to ground our
analysis, we devise a metric that allows us to predict which portions
of the kernel are less likely to contain vulnerabilities and which are more 
risky.  This metric is based upon whether lines of code in the kernel get 
executed by popular programs.  Our analysis shows that commonly used kernel 
paths contain fewer vulnerabilities.   

This observation has significant implications for how secure systems
should be designed.  As a result, we devised a novel ``safely-reimplement'' 
design pattern for secure systems.  We implemented a prototype security 
system Lind, that uses this design pattern.
%accesses only commonly used kernel paths, and have a very small trusted computing base that places only limited trust in the privileged code. 
Our experimental results show that programs run in Lind can trigger many
fewer vulnerabilities (X\%) versus existing systems like VirtualBox (XX\%),
Graphene (XX\%), and Bascule (XX\%).
